		intro: `Hello! My name is Daniel Thorp, a candidate for Communications Commissioner at the University of Ottawa Students' Union (UOSU). I'm dedicated to improving communication and making your voice heard.

Many students' concerns with the UOSU can be traced back to one fundamental issue: inadequate communication. Information about the UOSU is often inaccessible and hard to find. Running a student union is already a challenging task, but it becomes nearly insurmountable without strong support from its members. We need a union that truly delivers value to students, and that can only happen if the UOSU effectively reaches out to all of you. Whether it's advocating for your rights, providing services, or organising events, we rely on YOUR support to be successful and to be taken seriously by university administration, politicians, and external organisations.

I'm running for this position because I have the vision and the practical solutions needed to transform the UOSU into a student union with genuine support from its students.

As a software engineering student, I've been taught to tackle problems head-on and make the world a better place through innovative solutions. This is precisely what the UOSU needs right now—practical solutions and decisive action. I am committed to elevating our student union to new heights. I bring the passion to drive change, the unwavering dedication to be a voice for students, and a strong commitment to actively seek input from students. I will work relentlessly to enhance our presence on campus, ensuring that accessing UOSU information is effortless. My technical expertise will help us expand our digital frontiers, making information readily available online.

Vote for me, and let’s build a stronger union that students wholeheartedly support. Together, let's ensure that our communication channels are open and responsive.`,

As a candidate for the position of UOSU Communications Commissioner, I am deeply committed to elevating the University of Ottawa Students' Union's (UOSU) communication and engagement strategies. To foster improvement, I have meticulously outlined a comprehensive plan that centers on several pivotal areas and includes detailed policies to address them:

- **Design:** I will create a consistent email design that is visually appealing and easy to read.
- **Frequency:** I will establish a regular email schedule to ensure that students receive information in a timely manner.
- **Deliverability:** I will work with the university to ensure that UOSU emails are sent to students' inboxes rather than their junk folders.

## Community Building
- **Online:** Creating a UOSU Discord server as a hub for student connection and engagement.
- **In-person:** Creating spaces for students to meet, study, network, socialize, and host events, including progress on the UCU215 project and the creation of more student lounges.
- **Marginalized Students:** Fostering better relations with students opposed to the UOSU by facilitating dialogue and listening to their concerns.

- **Alumni Engagement:** Developing a strategy for engaging UOSU alumni, potentially involving them in mentorship programs or supporting UOSU initiatives.
- **External Organisations:** Building relationships with external organisations to enhance UOSU services and provide students with more opportunities.

## Governance and Engagement
- **Student Input:** Promoting transparency and active consultation with students through input-seeking mechanisms, surveys, townhalls, forums, and feedback loops to assess policies and initiatives.
- **Misinformation:** Enhancing communication strategies to mitigate misunderstandings and misinformation by providing clear, regular updates on UOSU activities and proactive engagement on social media.
- **Advertising:** Improving the promotion of UOSU services and events to increase student awareness.
- **Complaints and Suggestions:** Establishing efficient processes for handling complaints and suggestions to promptly and effectively address student concerns.
- **SharePoint:** Enhancing navigation, resolving permission issues, eliminating duplicate information, and improving student access to essential resources.
- **Office Hours and Atmosphere:** Implementing more flexible office hour times and fostering a welcoming atmosphere for students seeking assistance.
- **General Assemblies:** Increasing accessibility and participation in general assemblies through educational resources and clearer communication on assembly details and benefits.
- **Financial Transparency:** Enhancing transparency in financial matters, including detailed breakdowns of student fee allocations.
- **Cybersecurity:** Ensuring the highest level of data security and privacy protection, especially when handling personal information through various communication channels. Strengthening cybersecurity practices through vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and secure data storage.
- **Regular Reports:** Publishing regular reports and updates on the progress of initiatives and policies to keep students informed about the work being done.
- **Student Involvement:** Creating opportunities for students to get involved in UOSU activities and initiatives, including volunteering and employment (and CO-OP) opportunities.
