	platform: `Hello! My name is Daniel Thorp, a candidate for Communications Commissioner at the University of Ottawa Students' Union (UOSU). I'm dedicated to improving communication and making your voice heard.

Many students' concerns with the UOSU can be traced back to one fundamental issue: inadequate communication. Information about the UOSU is often inaccessible and hard to find. Running a student union is already a challenging task, but it becomes nearly insurmountable without strong support from its members. We need a union that truly delivers value to students, and that can only happen if the UOSU effectively reaches out to all of you. Whether it's advocating for your rights, providing services, or organising events, we rely on YOUR support to be successful and to be taken seriously by university administration, politicians, and external organisations.

I'm running for this position because I have the vision and the practical solutions needed to transform the UOSU into a student union with genuine support from its students.

As a software engineering student, I've been taught to tackle problems head-on and make the world a better place through innovative solutions. This is precisely what the UOSU needs right now—practical solutions and decisive action. I am committed to elevating our student union to new heights. I bring the passion to drive change, the unwavering dedication to be a voice for students, and a strong commitment to actively seek input from students. I will work relentlessly to enhance our presence on campus, ensuring that accessing UOSU information is effortless. My technical expertise will help us expand our digital frontiers, making information readily available online.

Vote for me, and let’s build a stronger union that students wholeheartedly support. Together, let's ensure that our communication channels are open and responsive.`,
