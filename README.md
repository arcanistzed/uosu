# UOSU Communications Commissioner Campaign Website

This is the source code for the website I created while running for Communications Commissioner at the University of Ottawa Students' Union (UOSU) in fall 2023. The website is created with Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion and is hosted on GitHub Pages at [arcanist.me/uosu](https://arcanist.me/uosu).
